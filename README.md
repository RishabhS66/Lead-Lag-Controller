# Lead-Lag-Controller-
Lead lag controllers implemented for a motor on Simulink. 
The aim of the simulink model is to track the position provided as input to the motor. Thus, 3 controllers have been designed to meet the requirements. All the controllers are one of the following controllers :
1. Lag Compensators : To improve steady state error.
2. Lead Compensators : To improve transient state response.
3. Lead Lag Compensators : To improve transient state response as well as steady state error.
